"""
gsyncio.channel - Channel-based communication between fibers

This module provides typed message-passing channels for communication
between concurrent tasks (like Go channels).

Usage:
    import gsyncio as gs
    
    async def worker(chan_id, send_chan, recv_chan):
        data = await gs.recv(recv_chan)
        processed = f"Worker {chan_id}: {data}"
        await gs.send(send_chan, processed)
    
    async def main():
        recv_chan = gs.chan(10)  # Buffered channel
        send_chan = gs.chan(10)
        
        # Spawn workers
        for i in range(5):
            gs.task(worker, i, send_chan, recv_chan)
        
        # Send data
        for i in range(5):
            await gs.send(recv_chan, f"Task {i}")
        
        # Receive results
        for i in range(5):
            result = await gs.recv(send_chan)
            print(result)
    
    gs.run(main)
